Before each match, run the following tests to verify subsystems are operating as expected:
    - Swerve forward / backward, strafe L/R, rotate
    - Intake / outtake
    - Elevator up/down (avoid going over L2 in the pits)
    - Elevator tilt in/out
    - Laser distance sensors (check controller rumble)
    - Make sure climber is set / wratcheted properly
    - Verify front IR light is on (use camera phone to see purple glow or look for faint red glow without camera)
    - Verify all cameras operational in photonvision dashboards
